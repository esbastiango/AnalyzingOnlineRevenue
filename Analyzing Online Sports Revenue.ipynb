Top Revenue Sneakers Analysis\n\nIn this section, we focused on identifying the sneakers with the highest revenue by analyzing the revenue of each product type, including the number of units sold and their respective ratings. The goal was to determine which sneakers contributed the most to total revenue, while also considering how many units were sold and the relationship with customer ratings. By examining this data, we aimed to uncover insights about product performance and customer preferences based on sales and ratings.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4c28336e-daf0-45f0-a0db-80894d4b55ec"},{"source":"SELECT info.column0,\n    SUM(finance.revenue / finance.sale_price) AS units_sold,\n    CEIL((SUM(finance.revenue))) AS \"Revenue\",\n\treviews.rating AS Rating\n\t\nFROM \"finance.csv\" AS finance\nJOIN \"reviews.csv\" AS reviews\nON   finance.product_id = reviews.product_id\nJOIN \"info.csv\" AS info\nON info.column1 = finance.product_id\nWHERE finance.revenue IS NOT NULL AND finance.revenue != 0\nGROUP BY \n    info.column0, Rating\nORDER BY \n    \"Revenue\" DESC\nLIMIT 10;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df11","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"type":"dataframesAndCsvs"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":389,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"e30df217-d955-450f-ac1f-39a772ff6e48","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"column0","type":"string"},{"name":"units_sold","type":"number"},{"name":"Revenue","type":"number"},{"name":"Rating","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"column0":["Air Jordan 10 Retro","Unisex Originals CRAIG GREEN KONTUUR II SHOES","Unisex Originals CRAIG GREEN KONTUUR I SHOES","Men's adidas Running Universal Works Ultraboost 19 Shoes","Women's Running Ultraboost 20 Shoes","Men's adidas Originals ZX 4000 4D Shoes","Men's Running Ultraboost PB Shoes","Women's Running Ultraboost 20 Shoes","UNISEX adidas Originals Pharrell Williams Hu NMD Proud Shoes","Women's adidas by Stella Mccartney Running UltraBoost 20 Shoes"],"units_sold":[401.4,154.7999916663,145.7999916663,169.2000100005,192.6000352962,111.5999857138,169.2000111117,176.4000235308,135,160.2000111117],"Revenue":[64204,37151,34991,33839,32741,31247,30455,29987,29699,28835],"Rating":[4.7,2.4,4.1,3.9,4.5,3.1,2.6,2.8,2.7,3.5]}},"total_rows":10,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                                             column0  ...

Additionally, while sneakers with descriptions between 100 and 300 characters lead in sales, the highest revenue comes from sneakers with descriptions between 400 and 600 characters.
