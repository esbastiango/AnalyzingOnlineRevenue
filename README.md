# Analyzing Online Sports Revenue
This repository contains an analysis of product data for an online sports clothing company, aimed at improving revenue through data-driven insights. The analysis leverages four datasets to examine key factors that affect sales, including pricing, reviews, product descriptions, and ratings. The project focuses on identifying patterns in product data and generating actionable recommendations for marketing and sales strategies.

This project is based on the suggested project from DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com/projects/1442), designed to provide hands-on experience in product analysis and improving business revenue.

### Product Pricing:
Comparison of Adidas and Nike prices.
#### Price Segmentation:
Categorizing products into budget, average, expensive, and elite segments.
### Description Length vs. Revenue: 
Analyzing how the length of product descriptions correlates with sales.
### Reviews and Revenue Correlation:
Exploring the relationship between product reviews and revenue.
### Top-Selling Products:
Identifying the top-selling sneakers and analyzing their revenue and sales performance.


## Datasets
The following datasets are used in this analysis:

**Brands Dataset:** Contains brand information for the products.
**Finance Dataset:** Includes product pricing and revenue details.
**Info Dataset:** Contains product descriptions.
**Reviews Dataset:** Includes product ratings and review counts.


## Analysis
In this project, the following analyses were performed:

Price Comparison between Adidas and Nike: We compared the pricing of products from both brands to understand pricing differences and their influence on sales.
Price Segmentation: We segmented products based on price into four categories: Budget, Average, Expensive, and Elite, and analyzed discounts in each segment.
Correlation between Product Description Length and Revenue: We analyzed how the length of product descriptions correlates with revenue and sales.
Review and Revenue Correlation: We explored the relationship between product reviews (ratings) and revenue.
Top-Selling Sneakers: We identified the sneakers with the highest revenue, analyzed their units sold, and compared them to their ratings.

## Results

Adidas led in terms of pricing variety, with 52 different price points compared to Nikeâ€™s 25. Adidas also sold more units across various price ranges.
Top-Selling Products: Despite Nike's lower number of total units, the Air Jordan 10 Retro ranked highest in terms of revenue.
Description Length vs. Revenue: Products with descriptions between 100 to 300 characters had the highest number of units sold, while higher-end products (elite sneakers) tended to have longer descriptions, contributing significantly to revenue.
Reviews and Revenue: While there was a positive correlation between the number of reviews and revenue, it was not strong enough to establish a clear cause-effect relationship.
